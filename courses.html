				<th>I enjoyed taking this class because it allowed me to write 
				(which is something I rarely do, but enjoy) in a more formal, intellectual, and
				emotionally distant way. It taught me a few things, and reminded me how much I love
				the process and feeling of writing a story.</th>

				<th>This was my first actual programming class I've had since attending OCC.
				While I have previous experience, and took a few theory-focused classes before
				and since this one, it was wonderful to get back to the thing I truly love to do.
				Almost all of the code present in the entire project was written by me, and while
				I hit a couple snags I couldn't figure out in order to get the game to display
				properly, I'm still proud of the amount of work that I accomplished.</th>
